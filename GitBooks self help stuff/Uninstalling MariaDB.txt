//Uninstalling MiriaDB by traditional means is VERY ineffective. What happens is if you uninstall traditionaly, and then reinstall. You get issues with old registries and pathways that for whatever reason I do not know, tied to the old install. And thus there is a disconnect to the new install. You have to do a thourough clean removal.


. Turn off MariaDB or MySQLin the Task Manager background process
. Uninstall per Control Panel
. Search and remove left over folders and files in the directory
. Run a registry cleaner if possible
. Remove all traces in the registry
. Remove the pathway in System Path enviornment variable
.
