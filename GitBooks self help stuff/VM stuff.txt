what VM are you using? i think some will use actual hardware and others will use virtual hardware. i think you can setup a drag and drop from host to VM, i typically setup a fileshare on the VM (samba or windows share) than drag and drop via network to the VM.

I simply use Hyper-v or virtual box, I’m there’s better suited ones. someone had mentioned a VMware that used hardware rather than virtual but I can’t remember the name. are you going to be using linux in the vm?

If you have windows pro, Hyper-v is free and seems quite responsive. It might be more difficult to set up than VMware or virtual box though

The vm should use your hardware and you should be able to partition the virtual drive that you created for the vm. I that you should be able to run a vm within a vm

If you do want to run a vm inside a virtual machine, you’ll likely need something other than hyper-v unless you’re just creating windows vm lol. I’ve had better luck using virtualization with Intel chips than amd but I can usually get the amd chips working

You will not be able to access drives outside of the virtual machine without an intermediary. One of things that makes vms useful is that through virtualization, they have created a virtual drive, memory etc where the memory contents can be destroyed but the machine that spawned it won’t be affected
