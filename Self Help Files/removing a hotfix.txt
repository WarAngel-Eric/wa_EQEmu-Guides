if you let the client stay .. does it eventually say you were disconnected?


[
8:56 PM
] 
you can hit F11 to see if the ping meter drops


[
8:57 PM

a disconnect occurs at around 66%



MarxisToday at 8:58 PM

UleatToday at 9:00 PM
yeah, if the server crashes, that meter will start to tic down noticeably


[
9:00 PM

and would explain the no return packet

check the other directory in logs called crashes


[

and see if you have any there
